# Real Estate Price Prediction, Recommendation, and Analysis System

This project involves developing a comprehensive real estate analysis tool that includes price prediction, property recommendation, and detailed data-driven insights. The system is built using several Python-based tools and libraries for data scraping, cleaning, feature engineering, machine learning, and visualization.

## Project Overview

### 1. **Price Prediction Model**
   - **Objective:** Predict real estate prices based on various features such as location, size, amenities, etc.
   - **Methodology:** Data scraping and cleaning were performed to gather and prepare the data. Feature engineering techniques were applied to enhance the model's performance.
   - **Model Used:** Random Forest Regressor.
   - **Performance:** 
     - R² Score: 94.41%
     - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Rs 0.27 crore

### 2. **Property Recommendation System**
   - **Objective:** Develop a recommendation system to suggest properties to users based on their preferences.
   - **Approach:** Utilizes the insights gained from the prediction model and other data analysis to recommend properties that best match the user's criteria.

### 3. **Property Analysis Tool**
   - **Objective:** Provide users with detailed insights into the properties, including market trends, comparative analysis, and more.
   - **Tools Used:** Streamlit for the web application, along with various Python libraries for data visualization and analysis.

## Results

- **Prediction Accuracy:** The Random Forest model achieves an R² score of 94.41% with a mean absolute error of Rs 0.27 crore.
- **Recommendations:** The recommendation system effectively suggests properties that align with the user's preferences.
- **Analysis:** The tool provides detailed insights, helping users make informed real estate decisions.

## Future Work

- **Model Improvement:** Further tuning of the prediction model to enhance accuracy.
- **Additional Features:** Incorporating more user preferences into the recommendation system.
- **Deployment:** Hosting the web application for public access.
